            <h1>Company Profile</h1>
            <p>The Company Started Business in1994 as two separate entities East Rand Milk Supplies and East Rand Milk Suppliers in 1996 the two units combined into East Rand Milk Suppliers (Pty) Ltd.<br>
            <br>
            The Business Focused on providing a service to mainly industrial offices and factories by delivering fresh milk during the night early morning hours so that coffee is available when people get to work in the morning.<br>
            <br>
            We acted as a distributor for various dairies.  During 1998 we purchased a small dairy processing plant in Balfour and started to process and package with our own plant.<br>
            <br>
            During 2000 we moved the Balfour plant to our current premises in Brakpan, as it was inefficient and costly to work from two remote locations.<br>
            <br>
            In order to obtain more synergy in our supply chain we bought a dairy farm in Devon in 2001 and started milking in 2002.  Farming was extended to grain production in part to feed our own animals and also a cash crop.<br>
            <br>
            Farming is very capital intensive we managed to acquire some critical mass with the assistance of Landbank it has significant potential but is limited by the weather and market conditions as the farmer is a price taker rather than a price maker.<br>
            <br>
            With the high input costs and the very competitive sales environment we decided in 2016 to discontinue milking and focus on grain farming.  We presently buy our milk from a distributor at a lower price than we could produce it ourselves.<br>
            <br>
            Our medium to long term plan is to install an advanced processing and packaging plant and start with some value added dairy products. <br>
            <br>
            Delivering a quality product to our clients has always been a priority to us and always will be.  We have been delivering milk to customers big and small for over 20 years making sure each customer regardless of size gets a personalized service and will continue to do so for years to come.
